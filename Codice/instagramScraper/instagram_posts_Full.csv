archrecordmag,None,250,"From the La Brea Tar Pitts to the Watts Towers to a venue that both cremates the deceased and offers outdoor screenings of Shrek 2, Los Angeles is not short on idiosyncratic cultural attractions.⁠ ⁠ That last spot, Hollywood Forever, is a cemetery, mortuary, and cremation services provider first established in 1899. In 1998, the flailing memorial park was resuscitated by new ownership after suffering decades of vandalism, neglect, and scandal. Renamed Hollywood Forever, the property was cleaned up, added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year, and refashioned as a full-service cemetery and cultural center. Today, its programming rivals that of a major contemporary arts center—there’s a wildly popular outdoor summer movie series hosted on the Fairbanks Lawn and regular concerts and other performances held in the Masonic Lodge near the main gate. ⁠ ⁠ With all these goings-on, it’s easy to forget that Hollywood Forever is an active burial ground confined to a compact swath of land in a dense urban area. There’s nowhere to grow but up. The recently completed first phase of the Sunset Mausoleum project is enabling the cemetery to do just that.⁠ ⁠ Rising above the eastern perimeter of the grounds is a 100-foot-tall vertical mausoleum constructed from poured-in-place concrete. Featuring large, cantilevered volumes suspended over Gower Street and a rooftop garden, the tremendously heavy but thin building—a “topographical landscape” as architects Michael Lehrer (@lehrerarchitects) and Roberto Sheinberg (@arq_y_di ) call it—will ultimately be flanked by two similar structures to the north and south that will be completed during later phases. ⁠ ⁠ Read more at the link in our bio.⁠ ⁠ Words by @mattyhick80⁠ Photos © @timgriffithphoto⁠ .⁠ .⁠ .⁠ #architecture #arquitectura #arquitecturamoderna #architettura #建築 #design #architecturelovers #archilovers #architects #architecturalphotography ⁠#architecturephotography #instaarchitecture #architecture_magazine #archdaily #architect #architectureanddesign #architectural #architektur #architecturaldesign #instaarch",2024-12-20,19:16,86450,5,300,1,2,20,False,0
